# Sentiment Analysis on Distance Learning During Covid-19 Using K-Nearest Neighbor

This project was made for my thesis with the same title. I implemented the K-Nearest Neighbor method to conduct sentiment analysis on Twitter regarding distance learning during Covid-19. The data used in this project was collected using [TAGS (Twitter Archiving Google Sheet)](https://tags.hawksey.info/) from February to June 2021, using the keyword #pembelajaranjarakjauh. The accuracy of the classification trial with the best model is 74.38%.

The Indonesian stopwords dataset and the model used for this project has been omitted for confidentiality.
